# SE4485-Capstone

## About the Project
The purpose of this project is to develop a simple C/C++ client-server application that runs on Linux (CentOS or Redhat) and utilizes seccomp to restrict each processesâ€™ abilities to make system calls at each stage of its execution.
#### Built with:
- C/C++
- TCP Networking
- Systemd
- An x86_64 Version of Linux (CentOS)
### Getting Started
### Prerequisites
### Installation
To properly compile the client and server, use the following commands:
- g++ -std=c++11 server.cpp -o server
- g++ -std=c++11 client.cpp -o client
### Usage
### Deliverables
- A writeup containing findings on use of seccomp
- A demonstration of the client and server program utilizing seccomp
- All code and other documents written for the project
